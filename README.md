- This is the cooperative project I involved during the experience in Microsoft.
- I developed a pluggable login/authentication system to help startups/small-businesses authenticate right easily
- I engineered and assembled JSON Web Token generator and validator and deployed them to the pluggable system
_ I re-architected and optimised the auth logic reducing around 40% of time
- Technology used: Java nimbusds 9.31 javax.mail 1.4.7 jakarta.servlet 3.1.0 + Springboot 3.0.2 Spring Framework 6.0.7
- I folked this from the original repo.

# PluggableAuthGroup25
The scope of this project is to build an end to end product to support login via email tokens to registered websites, managed the different login paths and inject this login method into any website.
